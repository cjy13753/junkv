# junkv
A toy-level key-value database from scratch written in Rust.

You can see how I am developing this toy project in [the following Notion blog](https://junnyjun.notion.site/junkv-cb212a9b65e7415991d80fe549394d99?pvs=4).
I am motivated by [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) by swyx to reveal the whole process in public.
I'd be more than thankful if you could provide some feedback through comments in the blog (if you have a Notion account) or in Github Issues as well.
